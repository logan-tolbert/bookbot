Guided project from boot.dev

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


This program analyzes the contents of a text file (.txt) to provide a detailed character count report. The report includes:

Total Character Count: A count of all characters in the file, including spaces, punctuation, and special characters.
Alphabetic Character Frequency: A breakdown of the occurrences of each alphabetic character (A-Z, a-z), presented in a clear and organized format.
